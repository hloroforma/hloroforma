- 👋 Hi, I’m GitHub user @hloroforma.
- 👀 I’m interested in simple coding/programming, more specifically using HTML and CSS to create webpages that allow me to experiment.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML and CSS. I want to start learning a new programming language soon - maybe Python or Ruby. But I like to start small. I'd like to work with Brainfuck one day. /j
- 💞️ I’m <b>not</b> looking to collaborate on anything, since that requires social interaction. And I really do not like social interaction.
- 📫 How to reach me ... well, I have a <a href="https://hloroforma.tumblr.com/">tumblr</a>, but that's about it.
